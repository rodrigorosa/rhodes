1.         Definitions.  In this Agreement, the word "Software" refers to the set of instructions for
computers, in executable and/or source code form and in any media, (which may include diskette, CD-ROM, downloadable
internet, hardware, or firmware) licensed to you.  The word "Documentation" refers to electronic or printed manuals and
accompanying instructional aids licensed to you.  The word "Product(s)" refers to the specific combination of Software
and Documentation that you have licensed and which has been provided to you under the terms of this Agreement. "Symbol Technologies" means Symbol Technologies, Inc. 

2.         Grant of License.
Provided that  you ("Licensee" or "you") pay Symbol Technologies, Inc the per copy license fee agreed upon between Licensee
and Symbol Technologies Inc, Symbol Technologies Inc grants a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the Products
subject to the Conditions Of Use set forth in Section 3 below and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Any terms
or conditions appearing on the face or reverse side of any purchase order, purchase order acknowledgment or other order
document that are different from, or in addition to, the terms of this Agreement will not be binding on the parties,
even if payment is accepted.  

3.         Conditions of Use. Any use of the Products outside of the conditions set forth
herein is strictly prohibited and will be deemed a breach of this Agreement. 

3.1        You shall use the Products
exclusively to support Symbol Technologies Inc devices.  Any use of the Products to support non-Symbol Solutions devices
is strictly prohibited and will be deemed an incurable breach of this Agreement. 

3.2        Only your employees
or agents may use the Products.  You shall take all necessary steps to insure that your employees and agents abide
by the terms of this Agreement. 

3.3        You shall use the Products (i) only for your internal business purposes; (ii)
only as described in the Products; and (iii) in strict accordance with this Agreement. 

3.4        Licensee may install
and use the Products on a single client workstation, provided that the use is in conformance with the terms set forth
in this Agreement.  The unmodified Products may not be transferred to another party without the express written consent
of Symbol Technologies Inc, regardless of whether or not such transfer is accomplished by physical or electronic means.

3.5.       Portions of the Products are protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty provisions,
and other applicable laws.  Therefore, you must treat the Products like any other copyrighted material (e.g., a book
or musical recording) except that you may either: (i) make 1 copy of the transportable part of the Products (which
typically is supplied on diskette, CD-ROM, or downloadable internet), solely for back-up purposes; or (ii) copy the
transportable part of the Products to a PC hard disk, provided you keep the original solely for back-up purposes. 
If the Documentation is in printed form, it may not be copied.  If the Documentation is in electronic form, you may
print out 1 copy, which then may not be copied.  With regard to the copy made for backup or archival purposes, you agree
to reproduce any Symbol Technologies Inc copyright notice, and other proprietary legends appearing thereon.  Such copyright
notice(s) may appear in any of several forms, including machine-readable form, and you agree to reproduce such notice
in each form in which it appears, to the extent it is physically possible to do so.  Unauthorized duplication of the
Software or Documentation constitutes copyright infringement, and in the United States is punishable in federal court
by fine and imprisonment.  

3.6        Licensee shall not distribute, sublicense, rent, loan, lease, export, re-export,
resell, ship or divert or cause to be exported, re-exported, resold, shipped or diverted, directly or indirectly, the
unmodified Products under this Agreement. 

3.7     Licensee grants Symbol Technologies Inc the right, which Symbol Technologies
will exercise at its own expense and no more than once per year, to enter Licensee’s premises during business hours for
the sole purpose of examining Licensee’s records and other information relating to the Licensee’s use of the Products.
If this examination reveals that Licensee has underpaid fees or improperly used the Products, Symbol Technologies Inc shall
invoice Licensee for such unauthorized use based upon Symbol Technologies Inc’ standard fees in effect at the time the
examination is completed.  If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the fees actually paid, then Licensee shall
also pay Symbol Technologies Inc’ reasonable costs of conducting the examination. 

3.8       Under this License, Licensee may
(i) use, modify, and incorporate all or portions of the sample source code (the "Sample Code"), runtime library files,
and/or documentation files (the "Documentation") that may be included in the unmodified Products into Licensee’s own
programs (the "User Programs") to support Symbol Technologies devices exclusively, provided that no license is granted
herein under any patents that may be infringed by Licensee’s modifications, derivative works or by other works in which
any portion of the Products may be incorporated; (ii) distribute the runtime library files and Sample Code in object
code format only as substantially modified or only as part of the User Programs to support Symbol Technologies Inc devices
exclusively; and (iii) use the Products solely for the purpose of internal development. 

4.         Title; Restrictions. 
Title to all copies of Software will not pass to Licensee at any time and remains vested exclusively in Symbol Technologies Inc.  Symbol Technologies Inc owns and retains all of its proprietary rights in any form concerning the Software and
Documentation, including all rights in patents, patent applications, inventions, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks,
trade names, and other intellectual properties (including any corrections, bug fixes, enhancements, updates,
or modifications to or derivative works from the Software whether made by Symbol Technologies Inc or another party, or any
improvements that result from Symbol Technologies’ processes or, if applicable, providing information services).  Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to restrict the proprietary rights of Symbol TechnologieS or to grant by implication
or estoppel any proprietary rights.  All intellectual property developed, originated, or prepared by Symbol Technologies Inc
in connection with providing to Licensee Software, Products, Documentation, or related services remain vested
exclusively in Symbol Technologies Inc, and this Agreement does not grant to Licensee any shared development rights
of intellectual property.  

4.1        If you transfer possession of any copy of the Products to another party outside
of the terms of this agreement, your license is automatically terminated.  Title and copyrights to the Products and any
copies made by you remain with Symbol Technologies Inc and its licensors.  You shall not, and shall not permit others to: (i)
modify, translate, decompile, bootleg, reverse engineer, disassemble, or extract the inner workings of the Software
or Documentation, (ii) copy the look-and-feel or functionality of the Software or Documentation; (iii) remove any
proprietary notices, marks, labels, or logos from the Software or Documentation; (iv) rent or transfer all or some
of the Software or Documentation to any other party without Symbol Technologies Inc’ prior written consent; or (v) utilize
any computer software or hardware which is designed to defeat any copy protection device, should the Products
be equipped with such a protection device.  If the Products contain Software or Documentation that is provided
on multiple types of media (such as diskette, CD-ROM, downloadable internet), then you shall only use the medium which
best meets your specific needs, and shall not loan, rent, lease, or transfer the other media contained in the package
without Symbol Technologies Inc’ written consent.  Unauthorized copying of the Software or Documentation, or failure
to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement, will result in automatic termination of this license.   

5.         Confidentiality.  You acknowledge that all Products contain valuable proprietary information and trade
secrets and that unauthorized or improper use of the Products will result in irreparable harm to Symbol Technologies Inc for
which monetary damages would be inadequate and for which Symbol Technologies Inc will be entitled to immediate injunctive
relief.  Accordingly, you will limit access to the Products to those of your employees and agents who need to use the
Products for your internal business purposes, and you will take appropriate action with those employees and agents
to preserve the confidentiality of the Products, using the same degree of care to avoid unauthorized or improper
disclosure as you use for the protection of your own proprietary software, but in no event less than reasonable care.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you shall have no obligation to preserve the confidentiality
of any proprietary information that: (i) was in the public domain at the time of disclosure; (ii) entered the public
domain through no fault of yours; (iii) was given to you free of any obligation to keep it confidential; (iv)
is independently developed by you; or (v) is disclosed as required by law provided that you notify Symbol Technologies Inc
prior to such disclosure and provide Symbol Technologies Inc with a reasonable opportunity to respond. 

6.         Right to Use Symbol Technologies Inc’ Name.  Except as required in Section 3.5 above, you shall not, during the term of this
Agreement or thereafter, use any trademark, of Symbol Technologies Inc, or any word or symbol likely to be confused
with any Symbol trademark, either alone or in any combination with another word or words.

7.         Payment.  The rights granted hereunder are contingent upon payment for the Products.  All payments shall
be due net 30 days from date of the invoice. 

8.         Upgrades and Updates.  If the Products are licensed to you as an
upgrade or update to a product previously licensed to you, you must destroy the Products previously licensed to you,
including any copies, within 30 days of your receipt of the update or upgrade. 

9.         Maintenance.  Symbol Technologies Inc shall not be responsible for maintenance or field service of the Software under this Agreement. 

10.        Indemnification. Symbol Technologies Inc shall indemnify Licensee by defending, at its expense, any claim, and any lawsuit
to the extent based thereon, that is brought against Licensee alleging that the Product, as originally delivered
by Symbol Technologies Inc to Licensee under this Agreement, directly infringes a patent or copyright registered in the
country in which Symbol Technologies Inc originally sold the Product to Licensee ("Infringement Claim"), so long as Symbol Technologies Inc is notified in writing by Licensee as soon as reasonably practicable as to any such claim, but in no event
after Symbol Technologies Inc would be prejudiced by a lack of such notice, is given sole authority and control of the
defense, and is provided by Licensee all requested information and assistance for resolving or defending the
Infringement Claim.  In addition to Symbol Technologies Inc’ obligation to defend, and subject to the same conditions,
Symbol Technologies Inc shall pay all damages finally awarded against Licensee by a court of competent jurisdiction to the
extent based upon such Infringement Claim, or agreed to in writing by Symbol Technologies Inc in settlement of the
Infringement Claim.  If the Product is subject to an Infringement Claim or, if in Symbol Technologies Inc’ judgment, likely
to become subject to a Infringement Claim, in addition to its obligation to defend and pay damages, Symbol Technologies Inc,
in its sole discretion, shall: (a) obtain a license for Licensee to continue to use or to sell the Product purchased
from Symbol Technologies; (b) replace or modify the Product so as to be substantially functionally equivalent but
non-infringing; or (c) require the return of the Product and credit the fair market value of the Product less
a reasonable charge for depreciation calculated on a three (3) year straight line depreciation basis. Symbol Technologies Inc shall have no liability to Licensee for any alleged or actual infringement, or otherwise, arising out of or in
connection with Licensee’s use or transfer of the Product after Symbol Technologies Inc’ written notice to Licensee that
Licensee shall cease use or transfer of such Product. Symbol Technologies Inc shall have no obligation to defend or indemnify
Licensee under this agreement  for any damages based upon a per-use royalty or the Licensee’s revenues, or upon any
damages theory other than a reasonable royalty applied to, or lost profits of the patent owner based on, the purchase
price paid by Licensee to Symbol Technologies Inc for the infringing Product.  Symbol Technologies Inc shall have no obligation
to defend or indemnify Licensee under this agreement for any alleged or actual infringement arising out of (a) use of
Product in connection or in combination with equipment, devices or Product not provided by Symbol Technologies Inc; (b) use
of the Product in a manner for which they were not designed;  (c) any modification of the Product by anyone other than
Symbol Technologies Inc; (d) compliance with Licensee’s designs, specifications, guidelines or instructions; (e) compliance
with a standard issued by any public or private standards body; or (f) any assertion by a non-practicing entity which
maintains no significant manufacturing capability ((a) – (d) defined as “Excluded Conduct”).  Licensee shall indemnify
Symbol Technologies Inc against any claim of infringement that is brought against  Symbol Technologies Inc based upon or arising
out of such Excluded Conduct or arising out of Licensee’s continued use or transfer of the Product after being noticed
to cease such use or transfer.  Symbol Technologies Inc shall not be responsible for any compromise or settlement made
by Licensee without Symbol Technologies Inc’ prior written consent.  THIS SECTION PROVIDES LICENSEE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDIES AND SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC’ ENTIRE LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.  LICENSEE HAS NO RIGHT
TO RECOVER AND SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE ANY OTHER OR FURTHER REMEDIES, WHETHER UNDER ANOTHER
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR PRINCIPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.

11        Limited Warranty.  All diskettes or CD-ROMS on which the Products are furnished ("Media") are warranted to be
free from manufacturing and material defects for 90 days after the shipment date of the Products to you.  Media that
becomes defective during such period will be repaired or, at Symbol Technologies Inc’ option, replaced.  This limited
warranty is contingent upon proper use of the Media and does not cover Products which have been tampered with, modified,
or subjected to unusual physical or electrical stress.  Tampering with or removal of any factory seal or label on any
Media voids this warranty and releases Symbol Technologies Inc from any and all liability. 

12.        Disclaimer.   EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC MAKES, AND YOU RECEIVE, NO 
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR IN ANY COMMUNICATION WITH YOU.  SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILTY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL
BE CORRECTED.  SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC MAKES NO WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY OF THE
SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion
may not apply to you. 

13.        Remedies.  The entire liability of Symbol Technologies Inc, and your exclusive remedy under
the warranty provided herein will be, at Symbol Technologies Inc’ option, to repair or replace any Media found to be
defective within the warranty period, or to refund the purchase price and terminate this Agreement.  To seek such
a remedy, you must return the entire Product to Symbol Technologies Inc, with a copy of the original purchase receipt, within
the warranty period. 

14.        Limitation of Liability. THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
FOR DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE PRODUCTS LICENSED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  IN NO EVENT
WILL SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY
NATURE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST BUSINESS PROFITS, OR LIABILITY OR INJURY TO THIRD PERSONS, WHETHER
FORESEEABLE OR NOT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SYMBOL TECHOLOGIES INC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Some
jurisdictions do not permit limitations of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions
may not apply to you.  This Limitation of Liability provision survives the termination of this Agreement and applies
notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement.  Licensee must bring any action under this Agreement within
one (1) year after the cause of action arises. 

15.        High Risk Activities.  The Products are not fault-tolerant and
are not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control software in hazardous environments
requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication
systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Products
could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities"). 
Symbol Technologies Inc and its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk
Activities, and if you elect to use the Products in any High Risk Activities, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
Symbol Technologies Inc harmless from and against any and all costs, damages, and losses related to that use. 

6.        U.S. Government.  If you are acquiring the Products on behalf of any unit or agency of the U.S. Government, the following
shall apply.  Use, duplication, or disclosure of the Products is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraphs
(c) (1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights clause at FAR 52.227-19 (JUNE 1987),
if applicable, unless being provided to the Department of Defense.  If being provided to the Department of Defense, use,
duplication, or disclosure of the Products is subject to the restricted rights set forth in subparagraph (c) (1) (ii)
of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), if applicable.  Software
and Documentation may or may not include a Restricted Rights notice, or other notice referring specifically to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall each continue to apply, but only
to the extent that such terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the rights provided to you under the
aforementioned provisions of the FAR and DFARS, as applicable to the particular procuring agency and procurement
transaction. 

17.        Term of License.  Your right to use the Products will begin when you click the "ACCEPT" button
below, which constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions herein, and will continue in perpetuity unless
terminated as follows.   Your right to use the Products will terminate immediately without notice upon a breach of this
Agreement by you.  Otherwise, this Agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30 days prior written notice. 
Within 30 days after termination of this Agreement, you will certify to Symbol Technologies Inc in writing that through your
best efforts, and to the best of your knowledge, the original and all copies, in whole or in part, in any form, of the
Software and all related material and Documentation, have been destroyed, except that, with prior written consent from
Symbol Technologies Inc, you may retain one copy for archival or backup purposes.   You may not sublicense, assign
or transfer the license or the Products, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.  Any attempt to otherwise
sublicense, assign or transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder is null and void. 17.1.     Licensee
acknowledges that Symbol Technologies Inc has made a considerable investment of resources in the development, marketing, and
distribution of its proprietary Software and Documentation and that reasonable and appropriate limitations on Licensee’s
use of the Software and Documentation are necessary for Symbol Technologies Inc to protect its investment, trade secrets, and
valuable intellectual property rights concerning the Software and Documentation.  Licensee also acknowledges that its
breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm to Symbol Technologies Inc for which monetary damages would
be inadequate. In the event of a breach of this Agreement and in addition to termination of this Agreement, Symbol Technologies Inc will be entitled to all available remedies at law or in equity (including immediate injunctive relief and
repossession of all non-embedded Software and associated Documentation unless Licensee is a Federal agency of the United
States Government).  Within thirty (30) days after termination of this Agreement, Licensee must certify in writing
to Symbol Technologies Inc that all copies of the Software and Documentation have been returned to  Symbol Technologies Inc
or destroyed and are no longer in use by Licensee. 

18.        Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America to the extent 
that they apply and otherwise by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. 

19.        Assignment.  This Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by you. 

20.        Survival of Provisions.  The parties agree that where the context of any provision indicates an intent that 
it shall survive the term of this Agreement, then it shall survive. 

21.        Entire Agreement.  This Agreement contains the parties’ entire agreement regarding your use of the Products 
and may be amended only in writing signed by both parties, except that Symbol Technologies Inc may modify this Agreement 
as necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations including FCC regulations. 

22.        Compliance with Laws.  Licensee will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including export 
laws and regulations of the United States.  Licensee will not, without the prior authorization of Symbol Technologies Inc 
and the appropriate governmental authority of the United States, in any form export or re-export, sell or resell, 
ship or reship, or divert, through direct or indirect means, any item or technical data or direct or indirect products sold 
or otherwise furnished to any person within any territory for which the United States Government or any of its agencies at 
the time of the action, requires an export license or other governmental approval.  Violation of this provision 
will be a material breach of this Agreement, permitting immediate termination by Symbol Technologies Inc. 

23.        Waivers.  Failure or delay by either party to exercise a right or power under this Agreement will not be a 
waiver of the right or power.  For a waiver of a right or power to be effective, it must be in writing signed by the waiving party. 
An effective waiver of a right or power will not be construed as either a future or continuing waiver of that same right or power, 
or the waiver of any other right or power. 

24.        Assignments and Subcontracting.  Symbol Technologies Inc may assign any of its rights or subcontract any
of its obligations under this Agreement, or encumber or sell any of its rights in any Software, without prior notice
to or consent of Licensee. 

25.        Entire Agreement and Amendment.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
of the parties regarding Licensee’s use of the Software and Documentation and may be amended or modified only by
a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each party, except that Symbol Technologies Inc may modify
this Agreement as necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  This Agreement will be fairly interpreted
in accordance with its terms and conditions and not for or against either party.
 
26.        Severability.  If a court of competent jurisdiction renders any part of this Agreement to be invalid or unenforceable, 
that part will be severed and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. 

27.        Third Party Software.  The Software may contain one or more items of Third-Party Software supplied by other 
third-party suppliers. The terms of this Agreement govern your use of any Third-Party Software           

UNLESS A SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE LICENSE IS INCLUDED, IN WHICH CASE YOUR USE OF THE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE WILL 
THEN BE GOVERNED BY THE SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY LICENSE. IF THE FOREGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU, 
PLEASE INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE BY CLICKING BELOW ON THE BUTTON LABELED "ACCEPT". IF THE FOREGOING TERMS 
AND CONDITIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO YOU, PLEASE CLICK ON THE "DO NOT ACCEPT" BUTTON BELOW.
