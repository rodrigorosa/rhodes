  Here is a quick summary for your reference:
  You encountered a problem in which ATL based ActiveX Control was getting set to zero size draw area in some versions of IE Mobile.
  We tracked down the problem to a bug in versions of IE Mobile which have the “Zoom Level” menu option.
  We identified a change that can be implemented in the control to work-around the problem and which does not appear to cause problems on other browsers, which don’t have the bug.
The problem can be worked around by overriding the InPlaceActivate implementation, of "CComControlBase", in the control code.  The work-around is described below:
To override InPlaceActivate :
1) Add the following function to your control class: "HRESULT InPlaceActivate(long iVerb, const RECT* prcPosRect)" to your control class.
    (if using the "Add Member Function Wizard" 
     * set "Return type:" to "HRESULT"
     * set "Function name:" to "InPlaceActivate"
     > First Parameter:
       * set "Parameter type:" to "long"
       * set "Parameter name:" to "iVerb"
       * click "Add"
     > Second Parameter:
       * set "Parameter type:" to "const RECT*"
       * set "Parameter name:" to "prcPosRect"
       * click "Add"
     * click "Finish" 
2) copy the implementation of "CComControlBase::InPlaceActivate" from "atlctl.h" into your new function, replacing the existing content.
      ("...\VC\ce\atlmfc\include\atlctl.h")
3) In in the code you copied search for the call to "CreateControlWindow"
4) add the following code *before* the call to "CreateControlWindow":
    if (rcPos.right == rcPos.left && rcPos.bottom == rcPos.top)
    {
        rcPos = rcClip = m_rcPos;
    }
    // now call CreateControlWindow...
5) save your changes and rebuild the control.
