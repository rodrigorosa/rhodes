1. Do not re-generate connection point code as I've copied across code from previous version. This is because the code generated by VS 2008 doesn't pass back the return value from the Javascript handler.

2. ShowSIP has some oddities, e.g. the first time you call it the SIP is shown then immediately hidden again (WM6.1).

3. If I change the classid in the idl to match the old control's value then it builds but won't register on the device, even on a clean device. In any case registration seems to need the creation of a cab file, rather than just a COM registration utility. To udate an existing SPB installation requires that the DLL have a different name (e.g. NoSIP2.dll). To investigate: how to set the class id of the control and register on a clean device.
