List of "Data" files for APD Kit v2.19.04    January 2009
=======================================================

A number of sample data files are provided for use with the "APD Print Demo" application.

Files are provided for printers from several manufacturers. A full list of these is given below. 

However, although these files are, generally, specific to one type of printer, it is usually possible to use the sample files with other printers from the same manufacturer by changing the filename 'extension' (assuming both printers use the same command language). For example, the files for MPCL printers have the extension "M60", which relates to a Paxar 9460 "Sierra Sport" printer. These files may also be used with the Paxar 9490 "Renegade" printer by renaming them. i.e. file "Format1.M60" would be renamed (or copied to) "Format1.M90".

For further information on how filename extensions are used, please refer to documents CPR361 and CPR576, included with the APD Kit. CPR361 also provides information about the use of 'format' and 'template' files. 


"Formats" Folder
================

For each type of printer, there are up to three files that are selected in response to the user clicking the "Format 1", "Format 2", or "Format 3" button. However, not all of these files are actually 'formats' (as used by the printer), though the demo application handles them all using the "Send Format" command. The list below briefly describes the purpose and content of each file.

Generally, all the "Format 1" files produce a basic label or product tag, and all the "Format 2" files produce a price reduction label. Depending on printer type, 'format' information included in the "Format 2" file (which defines the layout of the label) is stored in the printer and can be used again when the "Variable Data" button is clicked. This implies that, generally, "Variable Data" will not result in the correct label being printed unless "Format 2" has been used first.

"Format 3" files (where provided) demonstrate other features of the APD, such as the use of 'embedded commands' or variable-length templates.


"Template" Folder
=================

All template files must be located in this folder. Templates are selected automatically by the APD when required and there is no user 'button' for these.


"Variable Data"
===============

This data is not contained in a file, but comprises the following text generated by the demo application to simulate variable data:- "Hello 12345 12345". This text is inserted into various templates to produce the complete set of data and commands required by the printer.

Format1.M60	Product label (shampoo); price, description, barcode.
Format2.M60	"Reduced" label; includes format "1", used for "Variable Data".
Format3.M60	Label; uses Embedded command "0101" and template "L1.M60" (in "Template" folder)
      1.M60	Label Template; used to link "Variable Data" to format "1" (in printer).
     L1.M60	Label Template; used to convert data into MPCL (includes format "5").

Format2.S40	"Reduced" label; includes format "1", used for "Variable Data".
      1.S40	Label Template; used to convert "Variable Data" into 'Sato' command language.


"T12" Files:	For Toshiba-TEC SP2 printer, or B211 printer using a 'wired' connection
		Note: These files contain binary characters. Do not edit with "Notepad".
Format1.T12	Price reduction; inlcudes format "02".
Format2.T12	"Reduced" label; includes format "01", used for "Variable Data".
Format3.T12	Loads format "03", used by "Format2.T21"
      1.T12	Label Template; used to link "Variable Data" to format "01" (in printer).

"T21" Files:	For Toshiba-TEC B211 or B415 printer using 'RF' connection
		Note: These files contain binary characters. Do not edit with "Notepad".
		Note: Formats required must be loaded into printer first, using cable.
Format1.T21	Price reduction; requires format "02".
Format2.T21	Simple Label; uses Embedded Command "0101" and template "T1.T21". Requires format "03".
      1.T21	Label Template; used to link "Variable Data" to format "01" (in printer).

"Z40" Files:	Language = ZPL		Printer type = Zebra PA400
Format1.Z40	Product tag (shampoo); price, description, barcode.
Format2.Z40	"Reduced" label; includes format "1", used for "Variable Data".
      1.Z40	Label Template; used to link "Variable Data" to format "1" (in printer).



"ID_Label" Folder
=================

This folder, and the 'ID' files in it, are only required if the Symbol terminal is intended to use a "SPAN" cordless connection to send data to the printer. Their purpose is to support the APD's "Print ID" command (0108) and their use is not limited to use with the demonstration application.

Although these files are samples, they should work in virtually all situations and it is strongly recommended that these files are used 'as is'. i.e. do not change the text or filename extension unless you have a complete understanding of how these files work.
