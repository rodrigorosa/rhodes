7. **Environment variable** - If the **```rhodes```** repository is cloned inside the **```C:\project\rhodes```** directory, and if **```Ruby193```** is installed in the **```C:\Ruby193\```** directory, then append the path below to the System **```Path```** environment variable: 
 
    - C:\project\rhodes\bin;
	- C:\Ruby193\bin;

**Note: A correct setting of the environment variable on the development machine is required**.

#Windows Phone 8 Build Guidelines
1. Clone **rhodes** repository to the local machine

2. Create **rhobuild.yml** if it does not exist:
	- Open a command prompt and navigate to to any **RhoMobile Application** directory
	
	- Create ```rhobuild.yml```, if does not exist inside the **rhodes** directory:
		- Type from command prompt ```rhodes-setup```
		- At each prompt, set the indicated path and hit Enter (or just hit Enter to skip):
			- **Java JDK** (i.e. C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_74)
		 	- **Android SDK**  
		 	- **Android NDK** 
		 	- **CabWiz** (i.e. C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Mobile 6 SDK/Tools/CabWiz
			- Just hit Enter to skip the following: 
			- **BlackBerry JDE 4.6**
		 	- **BlackBerry JDE 4.6 MDS**
		 	- **BlackBerry JDE 4.2**
		 	- **BlackBerry JDE 4.2 MDS**

The file **```rhobuild.yml```** will be created in the cloned **rhodes** directory.

&#51;. Modify **```build.yml```** of **RhoMobile Application** that has been chosen for building. Point the ```sdk``` path to the cloned **rhodes** directory location. Ex: ```sdk: ../rhodes```

&#52;. From command prompt, navigate to **RhoMobile Application** project directory and type ```rake clean:wp8```. This will clean the earlier build binaries (if any).

&#53;. After cleaning, type ```rake device:wp8:production``` for production build of **RhoMobile Application**.

A successful build will generate the XAP files of the **RhoMobile Application** for **WP8**.
