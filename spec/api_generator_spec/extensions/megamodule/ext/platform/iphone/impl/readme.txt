Developer should create it - after first generation this folder is empty and this folder do not changed with next generation processes !!!.

Developer should make at least MegamoduleFactorySingleton.m with acees to MegamoduleFactory interface!
All other files include base_impl can be removed from project if it wants by developer.
Default stub generated code placed in stub_impl folder - you can just copy all files from /generated/stub_impl to this folder and implement unemplemented methods.
