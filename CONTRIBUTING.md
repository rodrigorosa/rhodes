# Contributing to Rhodes

Found an issue with Rhodes, give feedback or provide a patch?  Here's how!

## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within Rhodes. For application-specific or API-related questions, please visit our [Forums](http://forums.tau-technologies.com). Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** We sometimes get duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in Rhodes' code.
3. **Include a live example.** An example in the form of an accessible GitHub repository or easily-usable code snippet and test case should be provided. The simpler and faster it is to reproduce the issue, the faster we can fix it.
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, device, version of Rhodes, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Pull requests

- Try to submit pull requests against the latest `master` or `-stable` branch for easier merging, depending on where you are seeing the issue
- Try to follow the coding style of the file(s) you are modifying
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unrelated changes -- keep them simple and small
- Try to include test cases with your request, it will likely be accepted sooner
